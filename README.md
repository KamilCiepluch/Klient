# Client Application for Simple Board Game

This is a **client application** for a simple, multi-process board game written in C for Linux
systems. The application connects to a server using shared memory and thread synchronization mechanisms to allow interactive multiplayer gameplay. It supports up to four independent player processes running concurrently.

>  **Important:** This client requires a **running server instance** to function properly.  
>  You can find the server application here: [Server Repository](https://github.com/KamilCiepluch/Server)

## Game Overview

Each player (1â€“4) joins a shared maze and competes to collect and deposit treasure:

- **Collect coins:** `c`, `t`, `T`
- **Avoid danger:** wild beasts `*` and collisions with other players
- **Deposit loot:** at the campsite `A` to add to your permanent **budget**
- **Drop site:** if you die or collide, coins drop at the site (`D`) and you respawn
